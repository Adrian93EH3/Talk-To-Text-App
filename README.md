# Talk-To-Text-App
This app involves the "speechrecognition" webkit. Upon entering the webpage you will receive a prompt that asks you to allow the use of your microphone on the app. It will also ask this every single time you go to guess assuming you're not a wizard and guess the number off the first try. You must choose "allow" or else the app won't work seeing as it functions off of speech recognition. A randomly generated number will be chosen upon loading the app. If you say a number that's HIGHER in value compared to the randomly generated number; it'll display "GO LOWER". If you say a number that's LOWER in value compared to the randomly generated number; it'll display "GO HIGHER". If you guess the number correctly, you win! Play again to have another crack at it!
